                        <blockquote>1988: “Morris Worm”—  The first computer worm to be distributed via the Internet</blockquote>

                        <p>The Morris Worm, also called the Internet Worm, was the first computer worm to be distributed over the Internet. It was written by Robert Tappan Morris, a 23-year-old doctoral student at Cornell University.It was launched in 1988 from a computer at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the hope of suggesting that its creator studied there, instead of at Cornell University.</p>

                        </a>

                        <p>At the time, the Internet consisted of approximately 60,000 machines — around 6000 of which were infected by the Morris worm within 24 hours of its release. This paralyzed much of the Internet back then. It eventually infected thousands of computers at prestigious universities, government laboratories, and research centers. It drew massive media attention for its widespread effects and resulted in the first felony conviction in the US under the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.</p>

                        Like viruses, the worm was capable of replicating and propagating itself through networks, but it did not need a software host to exist. Despite being comprised of only 99 lines of code, it posed a huge threat due to a flaw in its propagation mechanism which allowed it to replicate at a remarkable rate. Its rate-limiting behavior was not effective, and a hundred or more copies could be running on a single machine, causing the server to become overloaded and non-responsive. Even uninfected machines were vulnerable to assault through multiple infection attempts coming from many independent sources. As the number of infections increased, the worm’s ability to limit itself decreased and it could not trace its progress or control it.

                    </div>

                        <p>It specifically targeted Unix operating systems, but it had multiple vectors that allowed it to spread beyond that initial limitation. The Morris worm’s most disruptive aspect was the intensity of its attacks on machines running the Unix sendmail program which resulted in denial of email service to large portions of the Internet. To spread itself over the Internet, the Morris worm exploited two major vulnerabilities in the sendmail program which were the DEBUG mode and the run program command. In theory, remote users could not access run program, but in reality, DEBUG mode enabled run program for remote users and this allowed remote code execution. If this tactic was unsuccessful, the worm tried to utilize rsh (remote shell) which was typically used for remote administration.</p>

                        <p>Login and password are required to use rsh, so the worm brute forced them. The Morris worm also functioned through the exploit of weak passwords and network logins with no password requirements via remote execution with rsh (remote shell). An impressively high success rate was achieved using only a small internal dictionary of 400 words, and some easy-to-guess passwords such as passwords identical to usernames or consisting of the same letters in reverse order.</p>

                        <p>Upon successful computer penetration, the worm checked to see if the computer was already infected. Morris had programmed the worm to duplicate itself at every seventh instance of a “yes” response in computers that said they already had the worm installed. However, the seven-to-one ratio wasn’t high enough to slow the program’s reproduction and it continued its operation regardless of other copies. Many computers became infected dozens of times. This programming error led the worm to spread much faster than Morris could have ever envisioned. The end result was occupying the machine’s resources until it shut down just like a denial-of-service (DoS) or distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack swarms a network with a series of requests until service is halted.</p>

                        <p>It’s important to note that the worm did not cause mass destruction or damage files. The damage came in the form of lost revenue for emails being delayed for days and lost time for the many systems administrators who had to work for hours to clean up the mess.</p>

                        <div class="flex-item flex-column">
                            <p>Shortly after the attack, Morris contacted two friends, admitting he had launched the worm and despairing that it was meant to be a harmless experiment but, had spiraled out of control due to a programming error. In an effort to mitigate damage, Morris worked with a friend to send out a message with instructions on how to dismantle the worm. Ironically, very few received the message in time because the network was too congested which prevented the message from getting through.</p>

                            <p>After the incident became public, the FBI launched an investigation and Morris was convicted in 1989. The court sentenced Morris to 3 years of probation, a $10,000 fine, and 400 hours of community service. His experiment in 1988 led to the beginnings of security regulations and laws that permeate the internet today. The idea of cybersecurity became something computer users began to take more seriously and Morris became a well-respected member of the computer society. Morris later went on to earn a Ph.D. at MIT, become a tech founder, a venture capitalist at the startup fund Y Combinator, and a professor of computer science at MIT.</p>

                    <blockquote>1999: “The Melissa Virus”— The fastest growing virus of its time </blockquote>

                    <p>In March of 1999, a programmer named David Lee Smith hacked into America Online Account (AOL) and posted a malicious file containing a catastrophe soon to be unleashed, by the name of “alt.sex.”. This file promised to contain a bunch of account and password information for many websites containing adult content that required the users to pay for accessing their content. When a user downloaded the document and opened it through Microsoft Word to view its contents, a malicious virus named “Melissa Virus” was also copied to their system.</p>

                    <img class="img-responsive" style="margin-left: 100px; width: 500px; height: 600px;" src="./img/melissa1.jpg" alt="">
                    <span class="caption text-muted">David Lee Smith - The creator of Melissa Virus</span>

                    <p>How the virus worked:</p>

                    <p>This virus, after being attached to the victim's computer, used a macro to hack into its Microsoft Outlook application. Moreover, it selected the first 50 email addresses in the prey's contact list and sent a message and an attachment loaded with the virus itself. The message attempted to lure the receiver to open it, with names like “sexxxy.jpg” or “naked wife”. The virus copied itself to the receiver’s computer once the attachment was opened.</p>

                    <img class="img-responsive" style="margin-left: 100px;" src="./img/melissa2.jfif" alt="">

                    <span class="caption text-muted">The email sent by the Melissa virus.</span>

                    <p>Damage due to the virus:</p>


                    <p>In just a matter of days, Melissa virus became one of the most significant cases of massive computer infections in the history. The total damage instigated accounted for more than 80 million USD, leaving a complete shutdown as the only options for hundreds of networks. Even big companies like Microsoft, Intel and Lucent Technologies had to block their Internet connections. A news article from New York Times reported that at least 100,000 workplace computers were affected by Melissa virus and around 250 organizations had to call the Computer Emergency Response Team, a Pentagon-financed security service, to ask for immediate actions against the virus.</p>

                    <p>What happened to Smith:</p>

                    <p>Within a week after the release of the malware, FBI was able to track down the electronic signature of the creator of the virus. David, the mind behind the virus, was arrested at his brother’s house. He later said at the time of his sentencing that he had no idea that the virus would have this sort of impact and inflict this kind of damage. He even said it was intended to be nothing more than a harmless joke and that he included features designed to prevent substantial damage.</p>
                    
                    <p>Smith was sentenced to serve 20 months in jail and was also fined $5,000. Although the initial term of his jail sentence was supposed to be 5 years, his term was cut shorter as he agreed to help authorities identify and prevent other malwares.</p>

                    <p>Aftermath of the virus:</p>
                    
                    <p>The Melissa virus served as an awakening call to many Americans. Awareness began to spread about the danger of opening uninvited emails and also the extent of the damage such malwares can instigate, not just on individual users but also on huge organizations depending on these computer technologies.</p>

                    <p>For the big security organizations, Melissa virus was a warning sign of a major growing and continuing threat and of the need to quickly scale up their cyber capabilities.</p>
