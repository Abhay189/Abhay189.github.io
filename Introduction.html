                        <p></p>

                        <p>Malware is most often seen in media and news, where many victims have reported that their programs were attacked by criminals who take advantage of malware to steal and misused their personal data and critical information for their gains. It's essential to understand what malware is and how it has begun to be integrated into our daily life as we fell into the cyber world to protect ourselves and our personal data from it. This website is to help to deliver what you need to know to prepare to keep your guard up against malware. We cover the types of malware and how to confront it to eliminate it, the history of malware to understand how it started, and how it evolves to current malware that make it more difficult to counter with the internet and technology that have been developed in more advance quickly.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Types of Malwares</h2>

                        <p>Malware can be in many forms with its own malicious purposes, and they require certain methods for us to eliminate them. There are about 7 common types of malware that we need to be aware of in case we may have to encounter at some point: viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, spyware, adware, and scareware.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Viruses  
                                <p>Viruses are frequently seen in media and news, where many people have reported. This type of malware automatically attaches itself to programs or files and modifies it in a way that when a victim's file is executed, the viruses are also executed. That way is what makes it harder for them to be cleaned up or eliminated. The only best method to eliminate it is to quarantine or delete the infected file instead altogether.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>Worms
                                <p>
                                The distinctive trait of the computer worm is that it's self-replicating, which requires little-to-no user involvement. It tends to be used as message attachments for emails and it would infect the entire company once a person opens the email, even computer security pros could not stop it from happening. 
                                </p>

                            </li>

                            <li>Trojans
                                    <p>
                                    Trojans can be hidden within seemingly innocuous or desirable programs and they must be executed by their victim to do its work. The most popular Trojan type is the fake antivirus program that pops up through emails or websites and claims you're infected, then instructs you to run a program to clean your PC. Unfortunately, users are not aware that this could be a trap and fall for it, which ends up becoming victims of it and their PCs taken over by Trojans
                                    </p>
                            </li>

                            <li>Ransomware
                                <p>
                                Ransomware is malware that restricts access to resources until a user pays a ransom to regain access. There are ways that ransomware can be prevented just like every other type of malware program, but once it is executed, it can be hard to reverse the damage without a good, validated backup. Hence, the best advice is to make sure you have a good offline backup of all critical files.
                                </p>

                            </li>

                            <li>Adware
                                <p>Adware is a type of malware that gathers information about users and exposes it to unwanted, potentially malicious advertising.</p>
                            </li>

                            <li>Spyware
                                <p>
                                Spyware is usually used by people who want to check on the computer activities of loved ones. It is also used by criminals to log the victims' keystrokes and gain access to passwords or intellectual property for their gains.
                                Adware and spyware require similar methods to be removed, which is doable because they have less criminal intentions than other types of malware.  The method is to find the malicious executable and prevent it from being executed using a protective program with an auto-protection feature. Make sure to keep it updated frequently.
                                </p>
                            </li>

                            <li>Scareware
                                <p>
                                Scareware is a form of malware that uses social engineering to cause fear or use threats to trick users into paying ransoms or unwanted software. It can be used to trick users into believing their computer is infected with a virus, then suggests that they download and pay for fake antivirus software to remove it.
                                </p>
